# myscripts
### This is a personal hub for my scripts
If you are interrested in there functionality please read the comment on the script itself to understand what it exactly does.
I am going to make a summary from time to time of what I add to this repository, but do not count on that all the time, I am doing it today, because I am in the corona virus quarentine in the UK and I have time in my hands at the moment... But I don't know about the future...

1. 	Mac-stuff 	*This folder has the osxscripts*, I am not very good on them, that is why they are minimum.
    I have created a script to load itunes on specifc times at specific days with specific playlists. So I have a playlist with monday songs that will play on Monday, Tuesday and so on...
    
1. Translation *Script for translation work*, I do translation of a radio program, so this is what it is for...

1. spam_scammers *This script was made to create ramdon emails and passwords*, there is a scammer who deserve not know who is real and who was created by this script... feel free to adapt it.

1.	backup-on-bluehardrive 	*backup with rsync*, copy all the computer content to a specifc hard drive when it is connected.
1.	backup.py 	*Same as above*, but written in python
1.	barcode.py 	*Add metedada to a video* I made this so I can add the disc barcode to my ripped media

1.	blockchain.sh *Just a study of blockchain theory*
1.	buscar.sh *Automatically download podcast episode*, Translation of a radio programme, remember I said... so this are the episodes being automatically downloaded... you didn't expect I would click to download one by one, right?
1.  check-videos *Select which video to delete or keep in a folder*, sometimes just reading the file name is not enough we want to play the video... This script does that, it play the video and when I quit the player it wants me to decide what to do keep or delete.
