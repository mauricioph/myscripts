# This are the scripts I used to translate videos.

1. **translate.sh** Get the video as audio, then transcript the voice into text using the transcribe.py script and then translate the text using another script which is not here yet.
2. **transcribe.py** This will get an audio file and write it on a txt file.

## To do:
1. Fix the translate python script, which is not here.
2. Make the text into subtitle format.
